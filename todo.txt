BUGS
- When first creating a book, the bookitems isn't populated, ie Zero bookitems
- Notification is to be shown only in User's homepage
  be it student/admin
  It is also being shown in login page :v
- Logging history about notification
- After book creation failed, edit page was shown.
- Book creation failed, count() function failed
- 24 feb:	- error on book search with type
			- user fine isn't displayed
			- addition and edit of book & book-items is not allowed

FIXED
- User that isn't admin can't edit their own profile
- The rollnumber field of user isn't autofilled during edit
- Can't create users "roll name field is required"
